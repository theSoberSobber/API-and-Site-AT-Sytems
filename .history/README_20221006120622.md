## AT-system-API&Site
To run the project -
- git clone it
- run yarn to install dependencies
- make .env.local file in the root of the folder, put the following in it
    - MONGODB_URI = <your mongoDB uri here>
- yarn dev to run "next dev" script

Please go to mongoDbTest.js in ./pages/api to understand the flow <br />
There, you will find some comments describing the schema and flow, they are pretty easy to understand <br />
Setup your mongoAtlas deployment accordingly (make the same database name and collections) and then put the URI to connect in the .env.local file (make one). <br />
You can help in implmenting it in the api and actually replacing all the hardcoded constratinsts to actual parameters. <br />
Test by actually dsending the requests to the api hosted at your localhost when you run yarn dev.
